# My Projects.
### Note - Some were followed from a tutorial which all the links are in the code themselves apart fron 'RPS.py' (read below for more information).
### Some things I will add in the future may be because I am working on them at school or finalising them at home and or have not finished them.
## In order of upload and mostly in order of doing it.

Discord-Bot:
Discord bot that I followed a couple of YouTube videos on.


Ireallydonotknow:
A Role playing game (RPG) that I started making in school and also at home. It only has one boss and I will add another boss just there is unlimited bosses I could add.


Online Saftey:
Something that I made so it would teach kids not to give their information away.


Idkaa:
Not finished but I will finish it soon. A padlocking game where you can guess the number and it will say how many you got right but not in which order until you get it right.


1-10 number and Guess the number:
Guess any number between 1 and 10 and if you get it right then it says correct. One I did at home and one was in school.


Idk.cpp:
Introduction to C++.


Area of a rectangle:
Tells you the area of a rectangle.


AandCofCircle:
Tells you the area and circumferance of a circle.


(Bad) Calculator.cpp:
A bad calculator.

C# tutorial:
Trying to learn C#.

Password:
Enter a password. I did more at school but I have not recovered it yet.


Tkinter Calculator:
The outline works for a calculator app. Only aesthetic, not functional yet since I am new to tkinter and had to follow a tutorial.


Heads or Tails:
Self explanatory.


Dice Roll:
Roll a dice a number amount of time.


TimesandDates:
Tells you the year month day and then the time. Followed a tutorial.


Dungeon:
Hopefully a long time project inspired by a repl.it project I saw and simular to Ireallydonotknow but more like a game and less like a story. I want to try and use the keyboard module in this project.


Password and Username:
You enter your username and It automatically generates the password, you then confirm the password and well that's it so far.


Quadratic:
Doesn't work but it still functions, I want to fix it later and thats why it is here.


RPS:
Rock Paper Scissors. Took me so so long and many hours for a simple project becuase I keep wanting to make it better and I am finally able to have completed it. Not much but it's honest work. Used https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_lower.asp because I got taught it in class but forgot how to use it.


SomethingIdidinclass:
Something I did in class because I was expanding on my knowledge but I just found it now.


HappyBirthday:
When you enter your Birthday Date and it is the same day that day then it will say Happy Birthday.


Qrcode:
Makes a qr code. If there is an error than I didn't run it since I'm still trying to use Visual Studios.


Qrdecode:
Decodes the qr code. If there is an error than I didn't run it since I'm still trying to use Visual Studios.


My (IN PROGRESS) website that may never get completed, depends if I give up.
https://################.anvil.app/#######################
I do have a domain, just once this is finished i need to find out how to use a domain I already have and host it.

I am currently working in ReactJS and therefore have abandoned the previous project, however, I will want to continue this when I am more confident in the languages I will need to use to create a website (front and back end).

Russion roulette:
Randomizes between 6 chambers and counts down. Gives you an option to give up if you think you will lose.

Kahoot Bot:
Manually Enters the pin and a bot name. (Made it in 5 minutes so it isn't the best).
